# Coming Soon

My [previous blogpost](https://amagibaba.com/posts/opt-failure/) gives a very clear visualization of how the latents of simple ReLU networks look like, how to interpret them, and a good description of optimization pressures that force them into or away from local optima. I feel well equipped to investigate the problems of [feature splitting](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html#phenomenology-feature-splitting) and feature absorption. Please reach out to me at ryan.rtjj@gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate.
